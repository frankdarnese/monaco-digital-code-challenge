# API Project

This is a __simple API__ fetching from a public recipe website. It has a restricted number of API requests.

## Factors considered:

### Code quality / linting

- Use of a clean and dry code.

### Choice of framework(if any)

- __CSS__: No framework. Use of SCSS, Flexbox, CSS Grid, BEM best practises.

- __JS__: Simple fetch API in vanilla Javascript.

### Performance

- Minified CSS

- Uglified JS

- Only 2 HTTP calls (no extra calls to any framework)

### User experience

- I have created a fresh, simple and modern layout with a quite obvious search bar which is self-explanatory.

- Cross-browser compatibility 

- CSS Prefixes

### Responsiveness.

- CSS Grid

- Flexbox

- rems instead of pixels
